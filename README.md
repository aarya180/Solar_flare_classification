# Solar_flare_classification
This work is done for Solar flares forecasting using multi variate time series climatological under sampled data. The project was done as a part of my course project in Georgia State University. The complete work report is included in the repository. Refer to the .ipynb files, if you are interested to see the work and the results achieved by us. This project is a good source of information, if you wanna know more about Multi variate Time series classification using sktime libraray. Particularily, we are using 3 different approaches, which involves sklearn baseline classifier, Time series forest using column concatenator and Time series forest using column ensemble.
